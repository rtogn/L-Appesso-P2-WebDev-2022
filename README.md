# L-Appesso-P2-Web_Dev-Spring-2022

# 「L'Appesso - The Hanged Man」, Project #2 Web Development @ GSU Spring 2022 

This project was implemented based on requirements provided by the professor at GSU in 2022. The goal was to create an interactive game using PHP, CSS and HTML.  
The primary goal was to gain experience with PHP and general website construction.   
The site uses a basic text file as a 'database' to keep track of users, passwords and win/losses.  
This file is parsed when the user logs in and when the leaderboard is accessed, it is not intended as a secure or efficient database schema. 

# Languages Used
* PHP
* HTML
* CSS

# Features

* User login
* Win/Loss tracking per user
* Leaderboard with randomly displayed card
* Hint system for words
* Admin dashboard with metrics on sales and listings
